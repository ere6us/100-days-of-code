- [x] Attempt Leetcode.
- [ ] Give hackerearth circuit.
- [x] Solve atleast 1 question on GFG.
- [x] Progress in DP

**Thoughts:** The question on GFG was of 2 pointer. Failed in first try, but succeeded in 2nd. Yay! Watched 2nd episode about different types of Knapsack. The Leetcode question made me realize I should improve my basics of algorithms.

### Day 3: July 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
- [x] Solve Leetcode.
- [x] Solve atleast 3 question on GFG.
- [x] Give mock contest (2 hours) on GFG.
- [x] Progress in DP.
- [x] Fuck mind on LeetCode over queue and recursion and finally solved one question.

**Thoughts:** Solved 3 questions on GFG. If I knew priority queue, I'd have done better in the mock contest. <br>
Learned recursive solution of 0-1 Knapsack problem.
